# Brief introduction about my project

Explore the profound impact of climate change through an in-depth analysis of Twitter discussions. Utilizing top daily tweets containing 'Climate Change' during the first half of 2022, a period marked by record-breaking extreme weather events worldwide, this repository investigates the correlation between public perception and climatic occurrences. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the study provides insights into the evolving dynamics of climate discourse on social media amidst the increasing severity of climate-related incidents.
