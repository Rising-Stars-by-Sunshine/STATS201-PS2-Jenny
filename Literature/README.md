# Literature

*1. Background/Motivation:*
This study addresses the challenge of automatically assessing attitudes towards climate change using social media content. As debates on climate change intensify, understanding public sentiments becomes imperative. Traditional survey methods possess limitations concerning time, expenses, and biases associated with participants. Utilizing social media enables real-time responses, bypassing predefined survey questions. However, interpreting and categorizing human expressions on these platforms remains arduous.

*2. Research Question:*
1. How can a Deep Neural Network (DNN) be optimized to distinguish climate change deniers from believers based on their Twitter posts?
2. What are the temporal patterns in climate change discussions on Twitter during the year 2016?
3. How do extreme weather events and policy changes influence the volume and nature of climate change discussions on social media platforms?

*3. Application Scenarios:*
The study utilized a DNN classifier to discern 'denier' or 'non-denier' tweets, shedding light on public opinions about climate change. The findings demonstrated that the DNN model achieved an 88% overall accuracy in identifying climate change deniers based on tweet content. Additionally, it highlighted increased climate change discussions from September to December 2016, influenced by extreme weather events and environmental policy changes.

*4. Methodology:*
Twitter data, obtained from Internet Archive using climate change-related keywords, underwent translation, manual labeling, and the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model. The methodology involved converting tweets into vectors and training a DNN model to distinguish between climate change deniers and non-deniers.

*5. Results:*
The developed DNN model effectively identified climate change deniers and revealed heightened discussions linked to environmental policy shifts and extreme weather events. These insights were derived from data collected, processed, and analyzed using translation, model-based analyses, and manual labeling.

*6. Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts:*
This approach not only showcased the efficiency of DNNs in classifying climate change attitudes but also emphasized the significance of social media in assessing public opinion. The study contributes to the application of deep learning algorithms in natural language processing, providing enhanced understanding of the factors influencing public attitudes towards climate change.
