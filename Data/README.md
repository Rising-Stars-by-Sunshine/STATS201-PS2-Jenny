The dataset, originally from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/climate-change-tweets), encapsulates daily Twitter discussions on 'Climate Change' from January 1, 2022, to July 19, 2022. Selected during a year marked by unprecedented global extreme weather events, this dataset offers a unique window into public sentiment during impactful climatic occurrences. The temporal scope aligns with the research's focus on understanding the correlation between climate discourse, extreme weather events, and environmental policy releases. Leveraging machine learning, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modeling will be deployed. This comprehensive approach aims to uncover nuanced sentiment variations and prevalent topics within the discussions. The dataset's extensive timeframe enables iterative exploration, allowing for refined insights into the evolving dynamics of public perception concerning climate change on Twitter amidst the backdrop of the climate crisis.
